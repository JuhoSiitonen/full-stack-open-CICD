CI/CD

In this hypothetical situation my language of choice is Python. For Python linting could be done
with pylint. The basic pylint setup has pretty good basic checks for code quality and it is easy to get started with.
Testing could be done with Pytest which can be used for unittesting. Also Robot framework could be used to test
user story level requirements. For build creation PyBuild would be an easy to implement solution or much used
Poetry which is used in Helsinki Uni courses using Python. 

Setting up a CI pipeline would be possible also with AWS, Azure or other services. I think this is even possible without a dedicated CI
software instance. For example basic web site running in Render can have multiple commands executed before the build becomes
active in production and Render can fetch the latest commit from the correct repository. So I guess basically 
almost any hosting service can have a CI pipeline with some tinkering. 

I think a small team making a relatively small application can go either way, but the easyness of cloud based 
environments might be a benefit here. If the application gets bigger it might benefit from self hosted services 
where the resources available would not be a bottleneck for development.
